Name: Brian George

Project: For Loops

Objective: 
    Write a program that will evaluate a simple math formula.
    Input the formula with two integers separated by an arithmetic operator from one line. 
    Example: 1 + 1, (-8) - 3, 2 * (-7), (-15) / (-4)
    Use a switch statement to print the correct value using the operators as cases.
    Set the default condition to an error.
    Ensure any division provides a double answer with a precision of two decimal places.
    NOTE: Scan the arithmetic operator as a char
